       "'Dear shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees of Samsung Electronics, we thank you for your continuous support and interest in our company.\\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic shook the world, fueling an unprec- edented public health crisis and prompting an economic slowdown as nations closed borders and implemented new safety measures to protect their populations. At the same time, the damaging effects of racial discrimination and a prevalent digital divide have become strikingly clear, while the importance of tackling climate change continues to grow.\\nAgainst the backdrop of these unprecedented times, it is no surprise that consumer behavior has changed, with priorities shifting to focus on areas such as health, safety, and sustainability. Expectations also continue to grow on corporations for sustainable business practices and operations.\\nAs a `sustainable, centennial company\\', we need to grow together with society to ensure we create a lasting legacy for future genera- tions to come. We have worked hard at every level to help our various stakeholders, supporting local communities and employees overcome challenges and adapt to the new environment as we return to our daily lives in a post-pandemic world.\\nWe provided financial support to suppliers struggling from the COVID-19 situation to help them stabilize their operations. We pro- vided medical staff and those particularly vulnerable to the crisis with medical and relief supplies as well as financial support. We con- tributed to accelerating COVID-19 testing and vaccine roll-outs by sharing our expertise and knowledge with small and medium-sized enterprises producing test kits and low dead space (LDS) syringes.\\nIn addition, under the CSR vision of \"Together for Tomorrow! Enabling People\", we donated tools and equipment, such as tablet PCs, to support young students with their studies online, aiming to lessen the digital divide among students around the globe.\\nThe pandemic has also served to remind us of the severe environ- mental issues we face. Notably, as the new climate regime has been implemented since 2021 in accordance with the Paris Agreement, the international community is now at a watershed moment in the fight against climate change.\\nAs a responsible global company, we are engaged in numerous ini- tiatives to minimize our environmental footprint, from product development to production and, finally, disposal.\\nAs part of our efforts to tackle climate change, we are proud to report that from 2020, all of our worksites in the United States, Europe, and China were 100% powered by renewable energy sources. We plan to build on this success by expanding our renewable energy use in other regions.\\nMeanwhile, we continue to drive a circular economy through techno- logical innovations and the development of high-efficiency products with greater durability. Our new programs, such as Galaxy Upcycling and Eco-Package, encourage consumers to participate in efforts to build a sustainable future in their day to day lives.\\nWe are deeply aware of the fact that compliance and integrity man- agement are at the foundation of sustainability management. We have updated our Global Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Policy to cultivate a deeply rooted compliance culture, and work with the external Samsung Compliance Committee to strictly monitor and manage any compliance risks, throughout the company.\\nThe unprecedented crisis has brought about rapid changes in the way people live their daily lives. Guided by our management philos- ophy which states, “we will devote our human resources and tech- nology to create superior products and services, thereby contribut- ing to a better global society,” and capitalizing on our technological advances and knowledge gained through many years of experience, we will continue to work with our stakeholders and society as a whole to allow a smooth and successful return to normalcy.\\nThank you.'"
